# passmaster

Intention here is to create an app I can have on my phone that will keep my passwords for all the services that require them. Its rediculous to have them floating around in my head, re-using old ones, and generally not having something to manage all of them. There are such apps on google play (and I assume in the App Store for the iPhone as well), but they are all rediculous and in my opinion not usable. Plus they usually have banner ads. This will be a totally free app, as I'm sure I won't be able to make any money off of it anyway.

The app will feature "secure" (or at least as secure as a psuedo-random number can be securely generated on Android using the NDK) password generation or use your own, strong encryption using the NDK (blowfish and/or triple DES with Whirlpool hashing, and the ability to export the encrypted data to other devices running PassMaster. 

I'm getting this out as soon as possible, this project has most of my attention at present becuase I really need it.
